Run-Buddy Website Design

# 'Run Buddy': A website design that matches runners with personal trainers. 
# Run Buddy is launching a new landing page to attract more sign-ups, and they need someone to build it. 
# Project Senario: A 'friend who works at Run Buddy put in a good word for you, and the company has agreed to hire you as a freelance web developer. 
# My job is to make the Run Buddy landing page look good, and then hand it off to Run Buddy's internal developers to complete the data collection portion.
